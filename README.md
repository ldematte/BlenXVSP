BlenX Visual Studio Package

A Visual Studio plugin which adds support for the "BlenX" language, created at the University of Trento - MSR center with Alessandro Romanel during our PhD.
The plugin adds intellisense, project, snippet, execution, etc. to Visual Studio. 
It uses Wintellect PowerCollections (inclued, as a DLL) and the Visual Studio Managed Package Framework for Projects (MPFProj - http://mpfproj.codeplex.com/)

I coded it during my Christmas vacation in winter 2008/2009, mostly as an exercise to explore how Visual Studio can be extended.
The source code is released under the 2-clause FreeBSD license.
